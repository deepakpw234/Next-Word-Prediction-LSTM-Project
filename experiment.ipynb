conceit\\n\\n   ham. what call you the carriages?\\n  osr. the carriages sir, are the hangers\\n\\n   ham. the phrase would bee more germaine to the\\nmatter: if we could carry cannon by our sides; i would\\nit might be hangers till then; but on sixe barbary horses\\nagainst sixe french swords: their assignes, and three\\nliberall conceited carriages, that's the french but against\\nthe danish; why is this impon'd as you call it?\\n  osr. the king sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes betweene\\nyou and him, hee shall not exceed you three hits;\\nhe hath one twelue for mine, and that would come to\\nimediate tryall, if your lordship would vouchsafe the\\nanswere\\n\\n   ham. how if i answere no?\\n  osr. i meane my lord, the opposition of your person\\nin tryall\\n\\n   ham. sir, i will walke heere in the hall; if it please\\nhis maiestie, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let\\nthe foyles bee brought, the gentleman willing, and the\\nking hold his purpose; i will win for him if i can: if\\nnot, ile gaine nothing but my shame, and the odde hits\\n\\n   osr. shall i redeliuer you ee'n so?\\n  ham. to this effect sir, after what flourish your nature\\nwill\\n\\n   osr. i

his\\nhead\\n\\n   ham. he did complie with his dugge before hee\\nsuck't it: thus had he and mine more of the same beauty\\nthat i know the drossie age dotes on; only got the tune of\\nthe time, and outward habite of encounter, a kinde of\\nyesty collection, which carries them through & through\\nthe most fond and winnowed opinions; and doe but blow\\nthem to their tryalls: the bubbles are out\\n\\n   hor. you will lose this wager, my lord\\n\\n   ham. i doe not thinke so, since he went into france,\\ni haue beene in continuall practice; i shall winne at the\\noddes: but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere about\\nmy heart: but it is no matter\\n\\n   hor. nay, good my lord\\n\\n   ham. it is but foolery; but it is such a kinde of\\ngain-giuing as would perhaps trouble a woman\\n\\n   hor. if your minde dislike any thing, obey. i will forestall\\ntheir repaire hither, and say you are not fit\\n\\n   ham. not a whit, we defie augury; there's a speciall\\nprouidence in
